# Big Fat Film Quiz App

The idea for this project was to create a web game where players had to guess the actor based on two films they had been in. It was partially inspired by the concept of the Six Degrees of Separation. It was built in 2021 was a summer project.

This was my first project made with React and Flask.

Before trying out the application be sure to have npm and Python installed.

To run the project do the following:

```cmd
cd movie-app

npm i

pip install -r requirements.txt

python api.py
```
